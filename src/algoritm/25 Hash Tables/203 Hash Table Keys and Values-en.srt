1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,840
All right.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,590
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,610
Next up we have two more methods to add to our hash table.

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,420
Are very similar just to them in one video.

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,610
Extremely similar.

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,730
There's one method called keys which returns an array a list of all the keys in our table.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,990
So you need to collect all of the keys and then another one called values that does the same thing but

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,600
for values so it collects all the values in a single array and returns that array.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,370
So if you've done much programming before and pretty much any language there is a way to iterate over

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,360
a hash table a dictionary javascript object and it often involves looking at the keys or looking at

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,960
the values as an array or some sort of iterable list and then looping over that.

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,550
So we're just going to implement similar functionality using our two method keys and values.

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,040
One thing that I didn't write here but I would pay attention to is how you handle duplicate data.

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:59,190
For example values it's very likely that we might have multiple values that are exactly the same.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,790
For example for keeping track of grades inside of our like if I'm a teacher and I'm going to map you

16
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,840
know Colts got to see Dave got an A.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,430
Liane Lizanne.

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,590
Has it got a C.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,530
That sort of thing.

20
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,400
Well there were two c's as the values do we return both of them.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,640
Or do we return one and most of the time it's just the unique values that you return and the unique

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,330
keys that you return and kids are supposed to be unique anyway but values aren't so feel free to implement

23
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:30,410
it.

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,150
Either way I will show both.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,920
So you can see how it works but implement two methods keys and values that are very very similar.

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,490
You can copy and paste the code from one to the other and just slightly tweak it.

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,270
Have a solution.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,810
Up next.
