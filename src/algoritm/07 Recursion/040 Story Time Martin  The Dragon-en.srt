1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,410
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:08,290
So this section is about a topic called recursion and I think often recursion comes to a lot of baggage

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,980
a lot of the students that I've taught in person have heard of the term recursion and approach it with

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,170
a bit of apprehension.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,360
It's somewhat intimidating.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,010
And I think that's because it's a little bit tricky to wrap your head around at first but then once

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,800
it clicks Well it's one of those things that once the pieces fall into place I think most people don't

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,400
struggle as much to understand it and they don't have to it becomes sort of second nature once you understand

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,180
how it works.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,120
But there is a bit of that first hurdle.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,530
And what I want to do.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,740
I'm not trying to scare anyone but I want to do is actually teach the exact way that I was taught recursion

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,610
in my first computer science class in high school AP Java there was this teacher oh my gosh what was

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,870
his name.

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,900
Mr. Mr. Carlson how are you.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,980
I remember his name.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,190
And he read a story to a very short story that helps explain this idea behind recursion.

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,810
So all that I'll say to preface this is that recursion is another.

19
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,320
It's a different way of thinking about writing solutions.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,330
So we can write a solution to a problem.

21
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,880
The non-recursive way which is called iterative or iterative really.

22
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,520
And then there's also the recursive way and I know that insanely vague.

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,170
So first I'm going to hop into this story shouldn't take more than 30 seconds or a minute.

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,340
Once upon a time there was Martin a little boy named Martin.

25
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,870
This was a way back before there were computers back when there was wizards in our world there were

26
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,790
wizard totalist and alchemist's And there's this little boy named Martin who was training with them.

27
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,720
And there was an angry dragon named the dragon and he happened to look like the new Dragon emoji.

28
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,330
So one day Martin is talking to to some wizard and this wizard gives him a task.

29
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,950
The Wizard says I need you to go talk to the dragon and I'm going to give you a list of numbers and

30
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,260
I need you to come back and tell me if any of the numbers on that list are odd and they didn't have

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,950
computers.

32
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,900
And they for some reason were unable to do this on their own that needed the help of the Dragon.

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,950
So Martin goes up with his list of numbers you can see it here.

34
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,970
And he says Excuse me Mr. dragon can you tell me if any of these numbers in the list are odd.

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,390
And the dragon is not in a very good mood.

36
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,630
He's a little hungry it's been a while since he had something to eat.

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,910
So he's angry and he says I'm sorry boy only tell you if the first number in that list is odd.

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,920
So he's not super angry.

39
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,580
He doesn't immediately burn him alive and eat him.

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,740
Instead he just says sort of grumpily.

41
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,800
I'll only tell you the first number in that list is odd and Martin is very upset because he doesn't

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,550
want to fail his task he says I need to know if any of the numbers are odd not just the first one.

43
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,020
And the dragon is even angrier.

44
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,960
And he says Sorry I only tell you if the first number is odd.

45
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,870
That's my final offer that's all I'll do.

46
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,750
So then the boy has a little bit of a think hmm what could he do.

47
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,590
And Martin comes up with a solution.

48
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,890
He goes to the dragon and he says OK fine.

49
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:15,240
What about the first number in this list and he gives from the whole list and the dragon says that's

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,340
not odd It's even as we can see.

51
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,410
Then Martin comes back and he says all right what about the first number in this other different list.

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,170
It's not odd.

53
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,490
He does it again.

54
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,820
What about this number.

55
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,140
The first number in this list is that God and the dragon says it's not odd.

56
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,050
And the dragon is getting pretty bored.

57
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,140
And then finally he says what about this number in this list the first number.

58
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,140
There's only one number left.

59
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,810
It's not odd.

60
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,940
And then finally Martin comes back one more time.

61
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,680
What about the first number and this list and it's an empty list and the dragon is very upset.

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,750
He says there's an empty list you moron.

63
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,880
There isn't a number in there.

64
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,850
How could anything be even or odd.

65
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,800
There's nothing in there.

66
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,850
And then Martin triumphantly says Ah.

67
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,770
So all the numbers are even in that list.

68
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,910
And then the dragon says I never said that.

69
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,640
I only told you if the first number of a list was odd.

70
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,200
So then Martin gets out of a pen or pencil.

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,180
I guess a quill.

72
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,840
Or maybe just a stick in the dirt.

73
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,940
There we go and he starts drawing.

74
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,570
And he says well I gave you this first long list.

75
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,000
You said the first number was not odd.

76
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,310
Then I gave you this shorter list and you said the first number was not odd.

77
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,350
Then it gave you this other list.

78
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,950
You said the first number was not odd that they give you this list.

79
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,350
He said the first number is not odd that they give you this empty list and you got really mad at me

80
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,350
but you said that there's nothing in there to be either even or odd.

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,600
So I can conclude that there's no odds in this list.

82
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,540
There's no odds not less no odds not one and not one.

83
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,240
And finally there are no odds in the entire first list that I asked you about.

84
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:59,850
So no not and the dragon says Oh congratulations boy you have discovered recursion is very condescending

85
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,150
and then Martin is slightly puzzled and says what you know about this the whole time and it turns out

86
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,280
this whole thing was just a test.

87
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,710
That's.

88
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,290
That's the way I spin it.

89
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,210
It's a test because otherwise it's pretty big.

90
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,990
Big waste of time to send this kid to Dragon.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,300
It's a pretty dangerous operation honestly.

92
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,120
Dragons are very unpredictable.

93
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,600
Just to find out if it was numbers is odd.

94
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,360
But on that day Martin discovered recursion.

95
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,810
So that is the way that I was first introduced to recursion.

96
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,470
I'm sure that you could update that and make it a little more exciting.

97
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:39,950
But the idea is basically taking one problem and doing it over and over on a smaller piece or on a changing

98
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,750
piece until you hit some endpoint which we call the base case.

99
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,580
So we'll get to that first let's talk about our objectives for the section.

100
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,940
So we're going to define more specifically more specifically what recursion is and how it's useful.

101
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,140
Understand the two essential components of writing a recursive function.

102
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
There's two things that have to be there.

103
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,390
Then we're going to talk about something called the call stack which if you haven't heard about well

104
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,820
explain what it is and then we'll also talk about how it relates to recursion how we can use the chrome

105
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,480
developer tools to debug the call stack and recursive function calls.

106
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,870
We'll talk about helper method recursion in pure recursion and compare them and you'll solve a bunch

107
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,060
of challenges and have a ton of exercises.

108
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,590
So this is going to be a little bit of a crazy ride for this section.

109
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,130
We've got a lot to talk about.

110
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,050
Remember what I said.

111
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,750
Recursion takes a little bit to click once you get it you get it.

112
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,360
But if you struggle with it that's totally normal.

113
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,290
I have seen many students take days for the item that sounds scary but take a lot of time to get it.

114
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,380
But then once they get it they understand it.

115
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,420
It's not a problem.

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,560
So don't beat yourself up if you have to review some of this or come back later in an online course.

117
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,850
You know it's hard because it looks like this is you know six or seven videos of content and it only

118
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,700
takes maybe 30 minutes or an hour to watch it all.

119
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:01,140
But that's not the time that I intend for somebody to to really take to absorb the content.

120
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,270
So just keep that in mind if you feeling behind.

121
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,980
That's normal.

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,270
With this this is it's tricky.

123
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:06,720
OK.
