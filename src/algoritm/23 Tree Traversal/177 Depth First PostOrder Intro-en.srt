1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,760
All right.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,530
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,230
Next up we're going to take a look at post order.

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,020
So just a slight tweak or a variation on what we wrote in the last video where we're basically going

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,910
to change the order of one line that we're going to move which will make a significant difference to

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,830
the actual output order.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,080
So if you watch the two videos ago when I introduced the depth first search I talked about there's three

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,250
main operations or things that we do for any node we need to at some point visit the node itself like

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,230
10.

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,960
Then we also need to traverse the entire left half and the entire right side.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,770
I shouldn't say half because it's not necessarily half but the entire left side and the right branch.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,740
And then do the same thing on this node.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,490
So do we visit it first then look at the left then the right.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,060
That's what we did in pre order.

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,670
If we go back here we start off by visiting 10 adding it to our list then looking at the left side then

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,500
once the entire Left is done then we go to the right.

17
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,560
So then we get to six.

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,400
We visit six.

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,180
We look at the left then the right.

20
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,890
There's nothing after she would just visit three and eight and then we finish out the right side of

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,390
10.

22
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,480
So that's pretty order.

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,990
We visit the node first then left then right.

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,610
Post order works differently.

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,700
You might be able to tell by the name post after we visit a node after we have looked at the left and

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,050
the right.

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,550
So we explore everything first we traversed the entire tree or the entire branch from a given node the

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,820
left and the right.

29
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,170
Then we visit the node.

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,210
So in post order we started 10 but we're not going to visit it.

31
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,640
We're going to look at the left and go all the way down to the left then all the way down to the right

32
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,720
and then we visit a node.

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,150
So we start at 10.

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,700
We go all the way to the left traverse.

35
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,320
So then we get to six.

36
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,580
We're going to go all the way to the left than the right and then add six in.

37
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,780
So that means adding three in first then we add the right.

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,110
We visit eight.

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:00,660
Now we visit six because we explored the left and the right of six then we don't visit 10 yet.

40
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,670
We've only done the left side of 10.

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,130
Now we do the right side.

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,850
So we go to the right of 15 which is 15 and from there there's no left.

43
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,320
So we explore the right.

44
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,290
We get to 20.

45
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:18,840
There's nothing after that so we add 20 and we explore and revisit 20 and we work our way back to 15

46
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,660
then finally 10.

47
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,800
So in this example in post order the route is the last thing that's visited for any node.

48
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,470
We explore all children before we we actually visit the node.

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,860
Now practically what this means is you just need to change the order of your code.

50
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,670
So if you wrote the solution or you're looking at my solution from the last video for preorder everything's

51
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,170
pretty much the same.

52
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,590
We're going to write a function.

53
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,200
It doesn't take any arguments.

54
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,100
We're going to make an array or a list to store the values of the things we visited so that we can return

55
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,360
it at the end.

56
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,990
We are then going to write a helper function that accepts a node and recursively.

57
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,760
We're going to do these three steps.

58
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,660
If there's a left property call the helper function on the left property if there's a right property

59
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,170
traverse the right property and then push the value of the node to our variable that stores our visited

60
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,220
values and then invoke the helper function with the current variable.

61
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,930
And then finally return the array of values.

62
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,920
So this is copy and pasted from the last two videos that go the same pseudo code except the order is

63
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,630
different.

64
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,100
Rather than pushing first and then doing the left and right we're going to explore the left explore

65
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,640
the right and then push the value in.

66
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,370
So that's Post order.

67
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,470
Give it a shot.

68
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,000
Just you know alter the code if you'd like.

69
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,540
It's good practice to write from scratch but if you're short for time or you're bored then just copy

70
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,190
and paste the line change the order and make sure that you get the expected output.

71
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:57,750
So if you use the exact same tree this is the output you should get for post order compared to do this

72
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,080
order here for preorder.

73
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,320
So give it a shot and see if you can get it to work.
