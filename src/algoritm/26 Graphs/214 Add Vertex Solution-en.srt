1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,190
So let's give it a shot.

3
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,920
I'll head over here and the first thing we need to do is define our graph class.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,200
We need to add our constructor doesn't take anything and we set this adjacency.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,950
That's the hardest part is spelling adjacency list is going to equal an object.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,460
OK.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,960
Then we add our method called add Virtex which accepts a new vertex key and then all we have to do is

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,910
do this dot adjacency list of Vertex whatever that vertex is instead of equal to an empty array.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,030
Now I didn't specify how this should handle duplicate.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,610
So if there's already a key in there we're one thing we're going to do with this graph class is keep

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,050
it simple.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,390
We're not going to you know add in a bunch of error handling.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,140
So if somebody tries to add a new vertex it's already in there.

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,190
It's fine if we overwrite it obviously in the real world you would want to add some sort of protection

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,340
in there.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,940
You know return or throw an error that says there's already a vertex in there or ignore it because our

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,100
code is just going to overwrite it and set it to be empty but it be super simple to fix out right.

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:16,000
We were just check if this adjacency list of Virtex if that exists.

19
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:23,240
Or let's say if it's not there then let's just do it on the one line and see how long that line is.

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,960
I think that's OK with me.

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,030
So we'll just do this just to keep it really simple.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,030
If there's nothing there already then make it an empty array and that's it doesn't even need to return

23
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,540
something.

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,700
Let's run our code.

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,160
Let's make a new graph.

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,720
Just call it g equals new graph.

27
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:40,770
OK.

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,870
And we do not add vertex of Tokyo for example.

29
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,630
We look at g at the adjacency list and now has Tokyo set to an empty array.

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,230
Do one more with what else should we do.

31
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,510
San Francisco Okay.

32
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,310
And basically that's all there is to it.

33
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,800
But let's just make sure that little tiny bit of error checking worked.

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,840
So I'm going to manually change this is not how you should interact with it but we don't have any methods

35
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,750
to do anything.

36
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,440
So I'm just going to change it.

37
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:21,240
Tokyo from an empty array to just have something in there so if we look at the adjacency of us now Tokyo

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,690
is not an empty array.

39
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,370
Pretend that that's an actual relationship that's data we care about.

40
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:33,140
So if I now did not add vertex of Tokyo again we don't want it to overwrite it.

41
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,220
And if we look we still have Tokyo set to its initial data.

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,690
OK.

43
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,730
So this is fine.

44
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,900
That's about as much error handling as we need.

45
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,790
Looks good that at Vertex really simple.

46
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,320
You didn't even need to do this first part.

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,490
Just set the adjacency list of that key to be an empty array.

48
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,000
Next we'll add relationships between vertices will add edges.
