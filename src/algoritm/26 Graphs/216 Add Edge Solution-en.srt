1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,520
All right.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,940
So let's implement an edge on our graph class.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,290
So let's just define an edge and it takes two vertices.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:18,710
I'll just go with V-1 and V-2 and then in here we just need to access this adjacency list of V-1.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,820
It's now equal not equal to excuse me.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,290
We're going to push into that V-2 and then do the same thing.

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:36,420
This adjacency list of the two we will push in not we want and that's all according to the specs that

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,270
I've laid out that's all you have to do.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,890
Now if you did want to add error handling and to make sure that this is a valid key and this is a valid

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,020
key you could do that just a couple of conditional statements but I mean I'll leave mine super simple.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,810
Let's just make sure it works.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,900
So I'm going to define down here.

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,120
Let's do the new graph.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,680
I'll fast forward through this.

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,220
OK.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,200
So I have three vertices in there.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,530
They should all be empty at this point.

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,100
Great.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,980
Now let's try doing g.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,600
Add edge from let's go from Dallas and Tokyo.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,270
Which direction doesn't matter because it's going to go both ways.

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,700
And if we look at our adjacency list we now have Tokyo is in the Dallas array and Dallas is in the Tokyo

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,320
array.

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,610
So if we wanted to make this a directed graph we just wouldn't do both of these.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,350
Right we would take the first one.

26
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,780
So the order would matter.

27
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:40,080
We would go from V1 to V-2 and only do this we wouldn't go from V-2 to V-1 but we're assuming that our

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,580
flight to go both directions which I think most airlines do.

29
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,030
I mean I don't know it's possible that they only have flights in one direction from one city to another

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,020
and they fly back a different route.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,000
We're ignoring that.

32
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,760
OK so let's just make sure it works again.

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,250
Just double check.

34
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's also add one from Dallas to Aspen.

35
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:08,410
And if you look at our Jason to us now we have Aspen has Dallas and Dallas also has Aspen.

36
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,240
OK.

37
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,260
So that's all there is to adding an edge.
