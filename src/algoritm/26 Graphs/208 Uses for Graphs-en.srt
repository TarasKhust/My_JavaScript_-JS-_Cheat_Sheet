1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,240
So now I want to talk about some real world applications.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,900
Where does this stuff come up a bunch of nodes connected by lions.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,910
Well all over the place.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,350
Social networking I'll talk about we'll also talk about things like mapping Google maps directions location

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,450
pathfinding routing when you request a web page.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:24,030
The actual response itself comes back in a bunch of different little packets all over the place across

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,710
this massive network.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,670
Really they're just used all over the place.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,880
But let's start by talking about social networking or just the internet in general.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,150
So this is a visualization I found on Flickr.

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,620
There's many of these out there but this was one of the only ones they found that had a license that

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,940
allowed me to use it.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,390
And I think this is somebody who can see I think with their name models I don't know if you use Facebook

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,300
or what social network their connections between their friends.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:59,520
I think it was Facebook and so each dot on here each node is a person like Kim the L and then you can

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,540
see all the connections that you know Kimmer has two other friends.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,310
And what's interesting here is that we can see there are these clusters.

18
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:13,110
There are some people that this person knows who maybe don't know any of his other friends or her other

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,730
friends like this Susan maybe they met on a cruise somewhere.

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,890
He was traveling.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,320
But then there's this giant cluster maybe they went to school together all these people or maybe they

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,960
live in the same city and they went to college years you know different groups here.

23
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,790
But this is a way of representing a social network.

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,000
So Facebook Instagram Twitter all of these they're storing your friendships your relationships and much

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,760
much more than just a name like we have here.

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,190
But that's the bare minimum really to represent the structure of a friend network of an actual real

27
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,180
world social network or think of storing actors and their relationships in movies.

28
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,640
And you know the different actors that have been in each movie you could store it this way.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,450
Here is a visualization of part of Wikipedia.

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,390
These are pages that link to one another.

31
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,620
And this is just a small subset of it there are way more Wikipedia pages than the nodes that you see

32
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,140
here.

33
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:11,190
But we can see there are certain clusters and like this one here or whatever this is it links to a ton

34
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,930
of different pages that themselves don't really link to other pages.

35
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,260
And this is just Wikipedia but the web itself the Internet in its entirety we could model as a graph

36
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,530
where we have web pages that link to another page.

37
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,970
So anytime that one web page links to another that would be a connection from one node to another Here's

38
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,100
another application.

39
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,520
When we talk about mapping this is a really really common one.

40
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,740
When we think of how Google Maps for example or Mapquest if you were back in you remember that printing

41
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,630
out directions I used to have to do that from my parents.

42
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,110
When you think about how you would store that map itself in roads it's just only talk about roads not

43
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,130
hiking trails not bike lanes.

44
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,060
There's a bunch of nodes different cities different locations waypoints restaurant whatever we're talking

45
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,500
about.

46
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,850
And then roads that connect them and those roads are basically the connections that we talked about

47
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,300
between the nodes.

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,920
And in this example this is in Guatemala to go from this one city beautiful city Antigua to get to Lake

49
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,110
added land which is a beautiful lake.

50
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,280
There are many many options.

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,680
This is only showing kind of the two fastest but of course we could go some ridiculous route like go

52
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,730
through here and then go over here then go up the ice and there's a bunch of ways to get there.

53
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,920
And Google Maps is basically calculating the fastest way to get there.

54
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,680
Along this graph there are many different options and there's many algorithms that talk about finding

55
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,060
that shortest path and what's the easiest way to do that.

56
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,580
And it's much more complicated than just the length of the road.

57
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,760
There's things like the speed limit of the road for example you might have a much shorter road but it's

58
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,520
windier or it's a dirt road.

59
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,740
You might have traffic that Google obviously takes that into account.

60
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,960
Things might be close.

61
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,370
It's a lot more complicated than just calculating the shortest path.

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,050
But my point is more that we can store this data using a graph.

63
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,150
It's a bunch of nodes connected by roads.

64
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,700
So recommendation engines that's another one.

65
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,440
When we talk about any time you see something on a Web site people also watch like on Netflix or who

66
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:19,230
you might also like X when you're listening to something on Spotify for example people you might know

67
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,230
Facebook or Instagram or Twitter they all suggest those.

68
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,860
This thing was frequently bought with on Amazon for example and many other web pages.

69
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,380
Those are all recommendations that are made to you and often the way that they're made the way these

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,730
all this data is stored is in some sort of graph relationship.

71
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,180
So here's a super simple example I made with two video games.

72
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,310
Imagine that we had this for every single video game ever made.

73
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,040
And I didn't actually write out all the data points but here's a graphic for the game Halo and for Borderlands.

74
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,260
If you're not familiar with the games it doesn't matter.

75
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,910
But what you can see here the ones in green I didn't actually write Tex for all of them but the things

76
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,970
in green they are nodes that both these games have in common.

77
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,620
So these are like genre elements maybe space future sci fi guns.

78
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,940
First person shooters.

79
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:14,790
But now imagine that you have this expanded not only to include every game in Amazon for example or

80
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:20,040
in steam or whatever app you use to buy a game but also other things besides just genres.

81
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,460
How about user reviews and clicks people who clicked on Borderlands also looked and browsed what else

82
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,100
or trailer reviews.

83
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,530
There's so many different things that you would take into account and then to suggest something let's

84
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,580
say about Borderlands and I finished it to have a little box pop up and say People also looked at X

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,850
you might just look you write code to figure out what games have the most in common.

86
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,930
Which ones share the most nodes.

87
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:45,490
OK.

88
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,300
Well in our graphics only halo will suggest Halo.

89
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:54,770
So the datasets get way more complicated but anytime we're talking about this sort of X also did this

90
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,350
or you might like this or you should buy this.

91
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,670
I guess that's a little more forceful.

92
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,000
You should buy but you might want this.

93
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,510
Those are recommendations pretty much always stored with some sort of graph structure.

94
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
I forgot I had a little diagram there.

95
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:14,110
The thing things in common in that box here's a cool graph structure that models all the different genres.

96
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,640
Most of the genres in music around the world.

97
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,920
So if we zoom in you actually see all of these connections appear it's pretty crazy.

98
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,330
So this purple Let's see.

99
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,970
Which one are you.

100
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,320
Purple is Jamaican slash and reggae.

101
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,720
And if we go and unfortunately the zoom is kind of annoying but if I had zoom in you can see.

102
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,140
All right.

103
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:43,600
So there's dub and then we hover over dub and you can see all of its connections to other nodes.

104
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:52,020
For example it connects to old school rap pioneers or if we look at deep funk and new funk it has some

105
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,300
connections over to freestyle and break dance on the right in red.

106
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,430
Or too early funk and funk.

107
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,700
Anyway this is a fun Web site to check out but this is a graph structure at its core storing modeling

108
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,090
the relationships between genres.

109
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,880
This one also has an added dimension though of time I believe as things developed.

110
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:21,570
You can see that down here are the more recent trend up top are the older types of music so you can

111
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:27,730
see like classical it's over here and what is this folk music is here anyway.

112
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,560
So graphs are really commonly used.

113
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:35,230
They're sort of exciting I think to know about and the next thing we need to do now that we have established

114
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,090
the base definition it's a bunch of nodes with connections between them and there's not a pattern like

115
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,700
there is for a tree or for a linked list.

116
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,740
There's sort of freeform and just nodes with connections.

117
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,330
What we need to do next is talk about different types of graphs and also a little terminology so that

118
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,630
we understand the type that we're going to implement which we're going to get to very shortly.

119
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,340
That's coming up.
