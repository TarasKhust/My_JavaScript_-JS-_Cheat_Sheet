00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,930
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,040
Next up we'll add two different methods to remove nodes.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,110
Excuse me vertices and edges.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,800
So first let's remove an edge so we'll need to provide two different arguments.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,190
What's the actual edge we're trying to remove from Dallas to Tokyo.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,120
OK.

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,220
And then what that actually means is removing two different pieces of data because our connection is

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,960
stored in two places.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,690
So write a method called remove edge that accepts to two vertices the names of two vertices two keys

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,180
in our list.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,160
Then it should reassign the key of Vertex one to be an array that contains everything that was there

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,900
before.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,060
Minus vertex 2 and do the same thing for vertex to reassign the key of vertex to to be an array that

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,160
does not contain vertex 1 and don't worry about handling errors in invalid vertices things that aren't

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,600
there just assume that we're calling these methods with valid names for all of vertices.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,840
So here's an example.

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:02,940
If this is the state of our current adjacency list if we called remove edge Tokyo in Dallas we are going

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,350
to need to remove Dallas from the Tokyo list and remove Tokyo from the Dallas list.

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,780
But that doesn't mean just setting it to be empty of course.

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,320
We can't delete the entire thing.

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,610
We need to maintain Aspen in there.

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:22,020
So really it just means re-assigning this list Dallas to be equal to this whole thing minus Tokyo.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,760
There's many ways of doing it but give it a shot.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,340
Here's what our end result would look like.

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,730
Tokyo is empty.

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,540
Dallas still contains Aspen.

27
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,440
But that connection has been severed.

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,530
Dallas and Tokyo no longer are on edge.

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,150
All right.

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,820
So give it a shot.
