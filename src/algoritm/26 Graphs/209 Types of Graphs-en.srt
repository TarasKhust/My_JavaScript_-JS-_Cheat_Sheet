1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,050
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,730
So we've talked about what a graph is generally some nodes with connections between them.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,720
Now let's talk about some particular types of graphs.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,920
First of all there's some terminology.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,250
These are the basic terms you have to talk about vertex and edge.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,670
So a vertex is what we the fancy term for a node.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:26,430
So when a graph when we say vertex it's just in our diagram one of the circles an edge is the connection

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,450
between the nodes.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,540
Then there are two pieces will come back to weighted slash unweighted and directed slash undirected.

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,880
But first let's look at this graph on this graph.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,620
Any of those circles are vertices.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,110
This is a vertex see.

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,960
This is a vertex B.

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,910
So I might use node and Vertex interchangeably but that the technical term like on Wikipedia you'll

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,300
see Virtex although it does say Notice well in the introduction vertex is like the technical term.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,500
And then these connections are edges.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,580
So this is an edge from Ada.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,140
This is an edge from A to B from B to D and so on.

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,790
So from one vertex to another that's what an edge is.

20
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,100
So there are many many types of graphs different distinctions and sort of how they're built and rules

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,630
they follow.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,760
Just like with trees and actually already hinted at this a tree.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,410
We actually click on them page for a tree.

24
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,720
The definition is that it's a graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path meaning

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,870
that to go from six to two for example there is only one path to get there to go from three to five.

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,000
There's one path.

27
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,040
Contrast that with some of our graphs here to go from B to D.

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,710
We could go here here to here or we could go here to A to B to F D.

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,940
And this is not even a great example some of the other ones we've seen there are way more edges with

30
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,990
more connections.

31
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,980
So for a tree to be a tree it's just a bunch of nodes with a bunch of connections so it's a graph.

32
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,870
However there's only one path from a given node to another.

33
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,390
OK.

34
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,370
Now let's talk about directed versus undirected graphs.

35
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,330
So this has to do with the edges the connections between the vertices.

36
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,890
So in an undirected graph there is no direction to or polarity.

37
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,000
You could say to the edges.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,090
So they are two way connections is another way of thinking about it a and b are a connection.

39
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,250
So is B to say if we are traversing this we could go this way but we could also go this way there is

40
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,490
no direction associated with an edge and that's useful oftentimes depends on what you're modeling.

41
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,110
But let's talk about like Facebook how Facebook model's friends if you don't have a Facebook Facebook

42
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,480
account you probably know how it works.

43
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,940
You have to request someone and then they will accept your request or reject it but hopefully accept

44
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,240
it unless you're a stock or something.

45
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,700
In that case you are both friends.

46
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:56,120
So you see that friends stuff on your web page or on your home page they see your content.

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,030
It's not a one way relationship.

48
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,270
So this is an example of what you know a couple of friends could look like on Facebook where if Maria

49
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:09,470
and Tim are connected that means Maria sees Tim's content and tim sees Maria's content.

50
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,300
Now let's contrast that with a directed graph.

51
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,750
So a directed graph is often represented with arrows which indicates the direction the polarity of that

52
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,610
edge.

53
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:28,270
So for example from B we can go to see we could traverse to see if we could traverse to a from E..

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,380
We cannot traverse to B we cannot traverse to D or to f.

55
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,390
So e is sort of like a dead end here.

56
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,140
So on on directed graph there is a direction assigned to the edge the connection between vertices to

57
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,070
vote for Texas disease.

58
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,590
Yes.

59
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,060
So that's how you would model a social network like Instagram or Twitter where our friendships are the

60
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,690
following relationship is not a two way thing by default.

61
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:01,430
For example on this chart let's say it's Instagram we have Maria who follows Tim and Tim also follows

62
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,640
Maria so they see each other's content.

63
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,610
But Maria follows Justin Bieber so she sees his content.

64
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,360
Justin Bieber does not follow Maria back much to her chagrin.

65
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,800
That would really make her day.

66
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,680
If Justin Bieber would follow her but he doesn't.

67
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,690
Same thing with tim.

68
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,190
Tim follows Justin Bieber Justin Bieber does not follow Tim but if you look over here Justin Bieber

69
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:29,430
does follow Kanye and Kanye follow Justin Bieber so you can see this sort of information in a situ in

70
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,190
a social network like Instagram is important because if you are a celebrity you probably don't want

71
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,130
to just see every single person's content who follows you.

72
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,920
You want to be able to pick and choose what you see unlike on Facebook where we modeled it with an undirected

73
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,440
graph because all connections are two way.

74
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,550
Although that does ignore the whole like Facebook celebrity pages where you can you know create a special

75
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,630
marketing account.

76
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,280
But if we're just talking about the basic typical user account on Facebook versus Instagram this is

77
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,010
how we'd model Instagram with a directed graph.

78
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,690
Facebook is an undirected graph.

79
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:05,970
OK.

80
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,200
So there's one other piece of terminology which is a weighted graph versus unweighted.

81
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:18,220
So right now this graph is actually unweighted because each connection between the vertices the nodes

82
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,400
each edge has no value associated with it.

83
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,020
But now get this.

84
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,930
There we go.

85
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,220
Magically it is a weighted graph.

86
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,840
So when we assign a value to the edges it becomes a weighted graph.

87
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,070
There's information about the connection itself.

88
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,250
So unweighted versus weighted.

89
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,920
Everything we've seen so far has been an unweighted graph.

90
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,390
This is an unweighted directed graph.

91
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,870
This is an unweighted undirected graph and this is a weighted but undirected graph.

92
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,630
So for example if we're talking about maps here's our same Google Maps example in Guatemala.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
I'll get rid of the map.

94
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,170
Let's say these are all cities or I don't know gas stations or any sort of points of interest.

95
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,890
There's connections or edges between them but they are weighted.

96
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,660
We need to know these values.

97
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,730
So if we're trying to calculate the shortest path we can add these it's not to scale by the way I just

98
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,890
picked random numbers but we would add up.

99
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:22,900
You know if we're trying to go from here to here we could add 40 plus 20 plus three or add 13 plus 120.

100
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,330
And you know figure out which is shortest.

101
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,200
Now this currently the way it's displayed is an undirected graph.

102
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,170
It's two way connections but maybe some of these roads are actually one way roads in which case like

103
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:42,970
if we were really modeling Google Maps we would have a directed and weighted graph where you know certain

104
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:48,460
roads like in San Francisco or Manhattan for example but really all over the world are one way road.

105
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,160
You can't just go any sort of way that you want.

106
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,330
You have to follow the rules and there is an actual value assigned to those edges.

107
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,950
So if we go back to something like Instagram this could easily be represented as a weighted graph because

108
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,560
you might like if you're a marketer if we're talking about Instagram's like advertising team internally

109
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,430
they care about these relationships not just who follows Who but also what their appetite is for that

110
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,450
person's content.

111
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,290
That makes sense.

112
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,690
So there would be some sort of value assigned to this relationship or more than one value so that Maria's

113
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,950
connection to Justin Bieber might be superstrong because she loves Justin Bieber.

114
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,530
But Jones maybe isn't as strong.

115
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,410
And you could easily store that using a graph data structure.

116
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:38,200
Keep track of you know how many times this person did X or Y or assign a value for how much they love

117
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,340
a certain person they follow.

118
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,240
So just because I'm displaying this part just to explain what a directed graph is I'm not saying that

119
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,540
it couldn't be a weighted graph.

120
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,400
All right so let's wrap up the terminology.

121
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,530
Let's go back here.

122
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,440
We have undirected graphs.

123
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,600
So what I first showed you in the last video there is two way connections or you could say that there

124
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,840
is no direction to the connections the edges between the vertices.

125
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:09,400
And even before that we talked about the term edge is the connection between two notes which technically

126
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,610
each node is called a vertex.

127
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:18,700
So then there's a directed graph where there is a direction assigned to an edge and edge could be bi

128
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,530
directional.

129
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,010
I could could point both ways but it also could point one way.

130
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,470
Then we talked about unweighted versus weighted so an unweighted graph has no value associated no magnitude

131
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,220
with each edge a weighted graph does have a value associated with an edge.

132
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,460
And so when we're traversing or when we're computing the shortest path for example we would use these

133
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,530
values.

134
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:40,960
All right.

135
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,040
I know those a lot.

136
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,480
Next we're going to talk about different ways different strategies for actually storing the information

137
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,320
in a graph.

138
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,450
How do we model it.

139
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:48,940
That's next.
