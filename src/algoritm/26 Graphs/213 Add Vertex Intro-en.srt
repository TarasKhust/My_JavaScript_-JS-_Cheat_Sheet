00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,930
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,360
Let's get to work implementing our graph class.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,900
So I mentioned in the last video we're going to use an adjacency list to do this.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:14,390
And our basic class for our graph is super basic a Tibet way of explaining that it's very simple.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,450
Let's put it that way.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,540
All we need is a single property called adjacency list or something similar to store the actual edges

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,050
the relationships the connections between our vertexes or vertices.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,940
So it will start empty and we'll add things in one at a time.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,880
But first we need a way just to add a vertex before we can add edges before we can draw the connections.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,250
We have to just add the dots the nodes so that's where we're going to start I should mention we're going

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,970
to do an undirected graph.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,990
For now it's very simple to change it to be a directed graph where the relationships that the edges

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,410
are one way there's a direction from A to B.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,000
For us we're going from A to B and at the same time bita.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,490
So when we add an edge and we'll talk about how we how we handle that.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,210
Well let's start with the basics.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,590
Adding in a vertex.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,060
So here's our first method.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,290
We'll use this as our skeleton add a vertex is basically a one liner.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,860
It takes the name of a vertex whether it's 10 or pineapple or Hawai whatever it is.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,270
We add that in to our adjacency of us.

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,130
So write a method called add Virtex which accepts a name of a vertex.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,420
It should add a key to the adjacency list with the name of the vertex and its value should be an empty

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,000
array.

25
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,500
So we add a vertex first before we can add an edge.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,470
So there's no connection at this point.

27
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,460
We're just adding in a simple vertex.

28
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:44,750
So if we had a graph called G and it was empty and we called add vertex Tokyo the result is that our

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,570
adjacency list looks like this.

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,860
Tokyo is now a key a value for Tokyo is an empty list an empty array and that's it.

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,440
So it's really really simple this one all that we do right the method you need to just make sure that

32
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,900
it accepts the vertex.

33
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,390
You add that vertex has a key with the corresponding value of an empty array to the adjacent to list

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,630
and that's all.

35
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,940
So give it a shot in the next video there'll be like a 10 second solution.
