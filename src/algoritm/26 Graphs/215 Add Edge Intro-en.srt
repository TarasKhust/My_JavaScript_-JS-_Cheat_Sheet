1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,870
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,600
Next up we'll focus on adding edges on drawing those connections between two vertices.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,460
So if we are adding cities in Tokyo in Dallas and Los Angeles and Hong Kong and that sort of thing let's

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,060
say that we are working for an airline we're representing like all the flights that an airline has and

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,070
the connections you know at the back of those airline magazines.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,280
If you ever read those anymore there's those maps that have all those lines from cities will do the

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,230
same thing sort of.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,510
We're going to model that data structure.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,330
OK.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,390
So an edge will represent a flight from one city to another that our airline offers so of actually at

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,720
an edge we need to specify the two cities the two vertices.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,720
We will just call them Virtex one and two.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:48,960
So the function called add edge needs to accept two arguments V1 V2 vertex 1 v vertex to whatever you

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:58,200
want and it should find in the adjacency list the key of Vertex 1 and then push vertex 2 into that array

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,040
and then do the same thing for Virtex 2.

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,740
So it should find in that adjacency list the key of vertex to push vertex 1 into that array.

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,020
And don't worry about handling errors.

18
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,630
If somebody enters an invalid vertex if that edge already exists don't worry about that for now.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,650
Let's just get the basics.

20
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,400
This is really more about fundamentally how this all works.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,690
So let me just show you roughly how it work.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,930
If this is what we have at the beginning like we can do this right now just add a new vertex added vertex

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,320
add a new vertex Tokyo Dallas and Aspen.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,500
There's nothing connecting them there's no edges.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,040
Then if we did add edge Tokyo and Dallas remember that this is an undirected graph.

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,020
So it doesn't matter if we do Tokyo and then Dallas or Dallas than Tokyo but our end result would look

27
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,740
like this.

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,560
Tokyo.

29
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,070
The key of Tokyo now has now has Dallas in its array.

30
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,120
And the key of Dallas now has Tokyo in its array.

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,030
Or if we did an edge from Dallas to Aspen which is really the same thing is Aspen to Dallas.

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,990
We end up with Dallas now has Aspen and they're in Aspen.

33
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,340
Now has Dallas.

34
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,100
OK.

35
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,000
So this is pretty short as well.

36
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:12,600
It's really just two lines that you need to do if if we're not doing any of the air checking as I mentioned

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,270
all that we're doing is accepting to write a method called an edge it accepts two arguments.

38
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,210
You take that first one and you find it in the adjacency list using it as is key and then you push the

39
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,750
second one into that array.

40
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,800
And then you do the same thing for Virtex 2 you push the first vertex into its array.

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,690
OK.

42
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,710
Let's see how it goes.
