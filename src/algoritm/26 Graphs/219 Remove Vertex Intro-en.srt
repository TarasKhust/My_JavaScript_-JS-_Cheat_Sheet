00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,910
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,320
So our final basic component around adding edges and vertices and removing them is removing a vertex.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,020
So let's say that you know we're modeling this airline and we used to fly out of I don't know Hong Kong

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,300
a lot but now something happened.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,400
We are it's I don't know why it seems like a place you would never pull out of fear an airline but let's

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,260
just say we were removing it from our map we don't want to fly to Hong Kong anymore.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,370
That means removing all edges and also removing the Virtex itself.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,370
So it's a little bit more complicated.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:36,180
So we'll write a function called remove Virtex and accept a single argument just the name of the Virtex

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,530
we're trying to remove.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,440
It should loop as long as there are any other vertices in the adjacency list for that vertex.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,330
So meaning if we have Hong Kong in our adjacency list and there are ten edges it's just 10 other cities

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,900
we need to loop through that and remove each connection.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,700
It's not enough just to delete Hong Kong from the list.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,740
We also need to remove all of the edges.

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,790
Otherwise we were left with these broken edges.

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,420
So inside the loop we'll just use our remove edge function.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,600
We already defined so we'll call remove edge for each edge in the vertex or trying to remove.

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,520
And then lastly will I actually delete the key in the adjacent to the list.

20
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,740
So let me show you what that looks like.

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,700
If this is our initial state it's a little more complicated.

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,660
Let's say we're going to delete Hong Kong the entire vertex.

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,330
So what that actually means deleting is this entire line of course.

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,570
But if we only got rid of this then we would have Tokyo still's a reference to Hong Kong.

25
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,410
Even if Hong Kong is gone and that's broken that's not good.

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,570
So we also need to remove that we need to remove.

27
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,640
Los Angeles has a connection to Hong Kong and so does Dallas.

28
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,490
So we need to remove all of that.

29
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,530
So our logic is really take Hong Kong.

30
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,660
That's what we're removing.

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,620
Loop over its array and for each one called remove edge which he already defined which will delete Tokyo

32
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,390
from Hong Kong and remove Hong Kong from Tokyo remove edge on Dallas in Hong Kong and so on.

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,680
And then finally we still need to actually delete Hong Kong.

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,820
The key so that there's no reference to Hong Kong in here.

35
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,980
And that's something you may not do very often.

36
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,030
I don't do it very often.

37
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,340
Usually you just leave it empty or set it to be undefined or something.

38
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,000
But let's just remove it entirely from our adjacency list.

39
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,710
But in Javascript you can do that with just delete and then the thing you're trying to delete.

40
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,880
So this is what we'd end up with at the end of the day.

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,580
All trace of Hong Kong gun.
