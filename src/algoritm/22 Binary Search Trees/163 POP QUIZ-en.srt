1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,640
A quick pop quiz here is this a valid binary search tree with these pieces of data.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,630
These numbers take a look.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,670
Posit if you need a little extra time the answer is No.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,210
So what's the problem here.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:23,660
Well if we look on this node 8 to the left three is indeed smaller than 8 but 6 is larger than 8.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,860
So that is not good.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,610
That's invalid.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,780
How about this one.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,060
Is this valid.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,250
Well hopefully you can tell right off the bat the answer is nope it doesn't matter what the actual numbers

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,320
are because this root node has three children.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,880
So it's not a binary tree any more.

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,510
So out of the question an forgivable.

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,330
Next here's a slightly larger one.

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,800
Is this a valid binary search tree.

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,750
Take a moment to think about it.

17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,240
The answer is nope.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,880
Once again And the problem area is right here.

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,380
So we have three.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,720
And to the right we have six so six is larger than three.

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,580
That's OK.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,070
But to the left we have four.

23
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,480
Four is greater than three and everything to the left has to be smaller than three.

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,680
So invalid.

25
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,570
So three invalid trees for different reasons.
