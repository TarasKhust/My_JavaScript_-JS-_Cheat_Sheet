1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,380
All right.

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,890
Next up is an shift.

3
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,670
So upshift will add a note to the beginning of our doubly linked list.

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,480
So it's about the same as what we did with a singly we.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,980
First we just have that extra connection.

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,920
So if we come over here and read you insert the beginning we'll add the number eighty five.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,330
All that we do is find the current head.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,540
We make a new node.

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,390
We point the new node at the current head.

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:31,000
Then we point the head of the current head at the new node and then we make this the head.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,830
That's the final step and we're done.

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,250
So it's pretty short all that we have to look out for is if the list is empty.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,560
And in that case we make the head and the tail the same thing.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,490
All right.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,780
So here's the pseudocode.

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,420
Create a new node with the value that's passed in.

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,210
If the length is 0 if it's empty set the head and the tail to be that new node.

18
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,940
Otherwise we'll set the previous property on the head to be the new node.

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,960
Then we set the next property on the new node to be the current head.

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,440
And then finally we move the head label.

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,640
We make the head the new node we shifted over or shifted over.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,090
And then we increment the length and then return the list.

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:10,890
All right.

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,050
So just to reiterate that we take the current head.

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,680
Well first we make the new node.

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,380
Then we take the current head and we have a new node point next to the current head.

27
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,020
Then we have the current previous set to the new node.

28
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,160
There is that other arrow and then finally we say this isn't the head anymore.

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,890
This is the head.

30
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,400
And we're done.

31
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,470
We just have to look out for the edge case when it's empty the head and the tail are the same thing.

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,170
All right.
