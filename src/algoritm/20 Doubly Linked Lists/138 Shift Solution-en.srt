1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,800
All right.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,700
So let's get working on shift.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,730
OK so the very first thing we'll do.

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,890
Aside from defining it it's adding that edge case.

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:15,360
Again we can check if the list is empty by checking if that head is no or if it doesn't exist or by

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,560
checking if the length is zero.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:27,660
So I'll do length this time we did this dumbhead last time I'll do if this data length equals zero return

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,870
undefined.

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,050
All right.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,440
Now the next thing we need to do is store the current head in a variable.

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:42,860
So I'll call it old head or shifted node or whatever you want to call it is right now the current head

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,590
of head but that's about to change.

13
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,000
First we have this edge case like this one and we remove the last item we need to make sure the head

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,770
and the tail are no.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,060
So if this length is equal to one we're going to set this dud head equal to no.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,930
I could've just copied this from above.

17
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,180
This tail equals nil.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,730
OK so that's that edge case.

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,090
Now we need to update the head to be the next of the old.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,930
Going back to this diagram.

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,490
I think I'll put in comments because it's getting an error if we have ninety nine and one hundred two

22
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,540
items in our list we have two connections to the next and the previous.

23
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,680
What we want to do.

24
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,240
We also have a reference to the head first.

25
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,770
This is the current head and I've stored it in a variable.

26
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,120
I'm moving the head to be 100.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,530
So I'm just going to say this head equals old head next.

28
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,790
So ninety nine dot next meaning.

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,860
This is the new head.

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,670
Now we just need to sever these bonds so it doesn't matter which one we do first.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,300
I can say this head meaning the new head dot previous equals no.

32
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:56,240
So that's going to remove that connection and then I can say old head dot next equals nil.

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,940
This is the old red dot next there's no old heard dot next no.

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,260
And now that removes this entirely they're not connected at all.

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,750
This is called the head now and this is it.

36
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,760
So I can return old head.

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:21,480
We have one more thing which is to decrement the length so this dot length minus minus and then return

38
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,260
old.

39
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,180
And that should be it.

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
So I just added in some code here.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,530
So I don't have to type push over and over.

42
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,810
You have to watch me do that.

43
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,210
So we have our list that has three items.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,750
Harry Ron and Hermione in there and let's do a list.

45
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,080
Shift.

46
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,270
So it looks like that works.

47
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,620
We got Harry back there next and previous is not totally isolated.

48
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,930
And if we look at the list now the head is rotten.

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,180
It has no previous.

50
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,780
That's correct.

51
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,310
It's at the beginning and the tail is her mind.

52
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,280
Let's do this double shift again.

53
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,050
OK we've got Ron on it's own.

54
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,920
And we look at the list.

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,730
It's one item now her mind the no next no previous.

56
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,740
It's just head and tail or her mind.

57
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,610
One more shift.

58
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,350
So we have a problem here which is that in this use case this use case scenario where length is one

59
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,650
we're sitting head and tail to be No.

60
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:27,630
We don't want to do any of this other stuff so I'm going to add an else here on these three lines and

61
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,930
close it up there.

62
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,830
And this is the same thing we did appear for pop we checked if there's one said the head and tail to

63
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,300
be no.

64
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,040
Otherwise do this.

65
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,800
So we had we set the head and tail to be no because there is nothing else to do.

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,880
And then we subtract one from length and returned the old head.

67
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:51,540
So just make sure it works rerun the code so I'll do that shift one time two times three times four

68
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,180
times.

69
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,270
And now the list is empty but we don't get an error if I keep trying to shift like we were doing or

70
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,900
where we were getting before.

71
00:03:59,290 --> 00:03:59,650
OK.

72
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,190
So shift is pretty much the same or very similar to writing shift for a singly linked list.

73
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,060
We just have to pay attention to previous and next rather than only next.

74
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,110
Next up we're working on surprise surprise on shift.
