1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,720
All right.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,420
Next up we have set on our doubly linked list so set takes an index like get.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,460
But it also takes in a piece of data or a value to update the node at that index with.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,370
So we can say set the item at index 3 to now be hallelujah.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,700
So if you implement it get from the last video set.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,010
It's really really easy because we don't have to do any of the logic to find the node that's what does

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,170
it we can call get and all we have to do is actually update the node.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,430
So the pseudo code is pretty short.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,520
Create a variable which is the result of the get method at the index that was passed to the function.

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,400
So we don't actually even have to check if the index is valid or invalid because we did that in get

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,800
get started checking if the index is negative or greater than or equal to the length.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,190
So we just use get pass in the index and what ever comes back if it returns a valid node set the value

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,230
of that node to be the value that was passed in to set and return true.

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,060
Otherwise just return false.

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,110
So you can do this one in just a couple of lines.

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,600
It's four or five lines.

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,230
It's just the same as what we did is I think it's identical actually to what we did with a singly length

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:12,960
list.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,470
So if you want to practice rewrite it put it super short.

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,110
All right solution coming up.
