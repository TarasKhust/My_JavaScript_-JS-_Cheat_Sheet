1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,810
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,280
Let's right set.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,360
So we're going to go below.

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:13,830
Get in at our set which takes an index and a new value and the first thing we do is just call get with

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,860
that index.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,290
So we'll do this get passed and that index and save it to a variable let's call it found Noad or no

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,550
call that everyone.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,050
I'm going to go with found a..

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,520
And then we're just going to check if found Noad or we could do it the other way and say if not found

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,100
Noad.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,220
So if there was a found node we could also be more specific and check if it's not.

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,000
No it's probably better.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:47,010
So if found notice not equal to nil we're going to take a found Noad dot Vau equals the new valve that

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,550
comes in and then we return to otherwise return false.

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:01,580
And we don't need to do an else we can just return false check our suit or pseudo code or anything else.

16
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,670
I think that was it.

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,520
And let's test it out.

18
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:04,880
All right.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,060
So we have our list and it has three items.

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,000
Harry Ron and Hermione let's just test it out first.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,730
Doing this does set a negative one negative for 100 or 10 apparently because I didn't type in next year.

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,070
And just make sure it doesn't work OK.

23
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,120
It's false.

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,370
Our list is unchanged.

25
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,240
Same thing if we tried to do with index of 10.

26
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,460
Same thing unchanged.

27
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:33,450
Now let's try and set let's say the first item instead of harry.

28
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,700
That's the all caps.

29
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,850
Harry you get true.

30
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,310
And if we look at the list it's still three items but the first notice Harry and everything looks good.

31
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,110
Otherwise it's still pointing to Ron which is still pointing to Hermione which is pointing to nothing.

32
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:54,110
Let's try and update her mind each index of two and we'll do all caps again.

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,170
And if you look at a list or look at the tail it's all caps.

34
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,070
Cool.

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,910
So that's working.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,130
That's all there is to set nice and easy if we write get that is without get it's a pain but we have

37
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,450
to get.

38
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,410
So it's nice and short.
