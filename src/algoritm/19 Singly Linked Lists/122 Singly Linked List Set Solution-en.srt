1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,140
All right we are all set to implement that.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:04,830
Yeah.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,550
All right.

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,790
So I'm going to hop over here and I'm going to add my method set which takes two things the index and

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,550
then a new value to set it to.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,900
And all we need to do is call our GET method with that index.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,630
This does get with the index that was provided set it equal to a variable civil which we'll call it

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,570
found node.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,060
And we're just going to check if that returns something valid or not.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,690
I don't know what I'm doing that for.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,440
It was already indented properly just fidgeting.

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,540
So get we'll take care of it.

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,650
And it's either going to return to us no or the actual node.

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:49,830
So if it's found in just you if found node all that we need to do is update found node vowel equals

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:57,270
the value that was passed in here and then returned true otherwise return false.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,940
We don't need to do the return.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,440
Else we don't need to do else return false because it's only one or the other either or.

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,360
OK.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,770
And that's actually it.

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,600
So it's nice and easy because we have this method already defined.

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,120
But let's test it out.

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,010
So we've got all this here let's do well let's run the code and I'll do list doesn't get.

23
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,250
What's the item at index 2.

24
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:21,560
All right.

25
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,830
It's an exclamation point.

26
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,770
Let's now set it list.

27
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,440
Set at index to to be triple bang triple exclamation point.

28
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,400
And if we look at the list and we look at list doesn't get indexed to now it's triple exclamation points.

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,600
However if I try and do list data set something in index I don't know six doesn't exist.

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,770
So it's false.

31
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,970
And if we look at our list and we do let's just look at the tail.

32
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,880
The last thing is still the smiley face.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,670
What else could we do here let's do list set negative 1 and set that to be Hellawell.

34
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,640
It's not going to work because our method is rejecting it returns no.

35
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,050
So we return false and that's all there is to set.

36
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,330
Nice and easy hopefully.
