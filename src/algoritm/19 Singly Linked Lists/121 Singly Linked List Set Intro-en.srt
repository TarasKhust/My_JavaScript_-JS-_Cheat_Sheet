1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,930
All right.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,790
Next up we're working with the set.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:10,530
So set is a method that will accept two things a position or an index and a value to update the item

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,380
at that index too.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,560
So we would pass in for example this visual go doesn't actually have the capability to illustrate this

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:26,590
but if I were to say this list don't set one as the index comma.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:34,230
Hello world what that is saying is take whatever that index 1 says 0 1 Take this node and update or

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,270
change its value set it to Hello World.

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:44,910
So to make it work you need to define a function that accepts two things a value and an index.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,790
I actually like to put the index first.

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,870
So I should have written an index and a value but it doesn't matter as long as you are consistent.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,610
And we can actually use our GET method that we just defined in the last video to help us out.

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,970
So we're going to use our get function to find that node or if it's not there or get function we'll

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:03,740
handle it.

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,140
For example if you tried to update the negative 10 item but it should return to us the found node and

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,690
then we just updated value.

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,540
So if the node is not found return false if the node is found update its value and then return true.

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,790
So it's a nice short one.

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,520
It's like four or five lines I think.

20
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,090
So in the next video we'll have a solution ready set go.
