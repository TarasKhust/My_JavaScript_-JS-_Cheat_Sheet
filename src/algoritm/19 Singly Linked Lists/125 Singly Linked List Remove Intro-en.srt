00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,300
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,390
So we're talking about a method called for move.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,020
We're almost done with singly linked lists.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,850
I promise.

5
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:13,530
Remove takes in an index and it removes the value at that index and it matches up the list around it.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,180
So if you were to remove from the beginning just take out the last item right.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,980
My gosh takes the first item.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,870
If you remove from the very end it takes the last item.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,460
But if you removed from the middle it's a little more complicated.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:33,350
So if we take an example if we remove the index of one from here all we have to do is first find that

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,070
item.

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,830
This is the one that's going to be deleted.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,880
Index of 1 0 1 and we take it out.

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:47,580
But to do that all it really means is taking the previous one and setting it next to the deleted ones

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,200
next.

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,290
So set this next to this.

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:57,770
So here's a pseudo code to find a function should accept an index if the index is negative or it's greater

18
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,910
than the length return undefined.

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,680
Or something.

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,150
No.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,100
Whatever you want if the index is the same the length minus one.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,380
So technically this should be greater than or equal to the length because you can't remove you know

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,090
if there's five items the length is going to be five.

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,580
But the greatest index is four.

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,300
So we can't remove from five.

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,200
We can only remove from 4.

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,770
So if the index is the same as the length minus one you want a pop.

28
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,770
Just use our pop method we've already written.

29
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,660
Same thing with the beginning if the index is equal to zero.

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,750
Use our shift method.

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,290
Otherwise use our Get method sort of what we did in the last video where we used to get.

32
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:43,660
But we passed an index minus one to get the previous node and then we just set the next property on

33
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,130
the previous node to be the next of the next node.

34
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,150
And then we subtract one from the length and returned the value of the removed node.

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,490
So give it a shot in the next video.

36
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,370
Surprise surprise will have a solution.
