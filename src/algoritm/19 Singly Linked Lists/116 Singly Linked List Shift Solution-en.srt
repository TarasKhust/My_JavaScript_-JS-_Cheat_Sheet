1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,750
OK so let's type this out.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,570
First we need to define shift and it doesn't take any arguments.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,450
And then let's start with this first one liner.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,470
If there's no nodes if it's empty return undefined.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,240
OK.

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:18,310
So down here we'll just do shift and we'll check again there's a lot of ways of doing this.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:26,000
If this Dalt length is zero if there's no head it doesn't really matter return undefined.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,560
OK next store the current head property in a variable.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,130
So I'm going to make a variable I'll call it current head equals knothead.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:45,170
This is pointing to in our case below at the beginning then we're going to move the head over to the

11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,720
current head next node.

12
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:57,140
So you say this dot head equals the current heads dot next.

13
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,630
So we've saved this to a variable called current head and we say this is the old hood.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,530
Well now the new head is right here.

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,780
We take current head next and make that the new head.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,510
All right.

17
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,950
Almost there then we need to document the length by 1.

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,430
So this length minus minus.

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,800
And then finally return current head which is technically no longer current.

20
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,160
So you could have also called this old head removed head doesn't matter.

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,140
This is what we took off.

22
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:40,600
And if we test it out run our code if i do list that shift we get hello which is the beginning and if

23
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,390
we look at the list now it's two items long in which the head the head is now.

24
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,320
Goodbye.

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,640
Let's do it one more time.

26
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,870
We got good bye off.

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:56,970
Now the head if we look at the list again is equal to this head and tail are the same thing.

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,380
I will note though if we do list that shift one more time it does give us the right value.

29
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,520
And if we look at list the head is no the tail isn't.

30
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,500
No and that's not really going to be a problem because as soon as we reassign something to the head

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,670
as we push something back in the tail will be reassigned.

32
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,240
However if we wanted to fix that if we wanted it to be no we could just add an extra conditional check

33
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,250
and just check you know right here if this basically just copy this code.

34
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,430
Set tail to be null just like that.

35
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:41,850
So if we refresh our code run it again list that shift shift again.

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,800
Right now the list has one item in it which is the exclamation point.

37
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,470
If we shift to a more time and we look at the list it now is NO NO.

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,670
Lanc this year so if you try it again we get undefined the lists unchanged the length is still zero.

39
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,250
Let's just make sure we can still push something in let's push 100 in.

40
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:08,550
We look at the list head and tail are both one hundred push or more thing in one thousand.

41
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,310
Anyway it's working.

42
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,400
All looks good.

43
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,460
Let's pop gives us 1000 list.

44
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,420
That shift gives us 100 and list is now empty.

45
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,020
Perfect.

46
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,260
All right.

47
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,060
So that's shift.
