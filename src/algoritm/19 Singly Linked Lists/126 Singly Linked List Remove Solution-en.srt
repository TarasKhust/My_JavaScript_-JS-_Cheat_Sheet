1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,630
All right.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,650
So let's write a solution for Remove going to hop over to my snippet and we'll define remove which takes

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,440
an index and the very first thing it needs to do is check if that index is valid.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,340
So if it if the index is negative if it's less than zero or if the index is greater than or equal to

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:28,960
the length what do we do we return no or undefined it doesn't really matter.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,540
Just something bad.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Yes he could return false too.

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,670
If the index is zero we're going to return this dot shift.

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:46,270
That means remove the first thing and if the index is the length minus one.

10
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,500
If it's the last item then we return this top up.

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,700
OK so those are the three edge cases.

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,110
Then we have the rest of the logic.

13
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,690
So this means if we get to this point and we haven't returned yet it's somewhere in the middle of the

14
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,270
list that we're trying to remove.

15
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,370
So we need to find the previous node.

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,320
So let's make a variable called previous node equals.

17
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,250
This get index minus 1.

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,120
So retrieve the value of retrieve the Node 1 before.

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,840
What we're trying to remove then what I'm going to do is make a node a variable called removed and it's

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,240
going to store a previous node next.

21
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,050
So this is what we're going to return to the very end.

22
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,430
Can actually just do that now.

23
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,730
Return removed but it's not removed yet.

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:42,380
So now all we need to do is set previous node next equals removed next.

25
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,010
So if we're trying to remove this right here we find the previous Node 2 0 1 and we make a variable

26
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,360
called removed and we set it equal to this dot next.

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,850
So this is going to be in our removed variable.

28
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,760
Then we take the previous node next and set it to removed next.

29
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,700
So we take this and said it's next to this.

30
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,530
At which point this is out of the picture we have it in a variable so we can return it at the end.

31
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,480
But we also need to before that.

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,820
Subtract one from the length.

33
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,750
So this dot length minus minus and that should do it for us.

34
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,950
Let's try executing it let's do list.

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,400
Does it remove the first item.

36
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,920
So that gives us 100 and the list now starts at 2 0 1.

37
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,330
Let's remove from the end remove.

38
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,230
Actually that's do from the middle first let's do index of 2.

39
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,390
So that should be if we remove this index of 2.

40
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,340
It's going to be the last thing isn't it.

41
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,000
OK that's two index of one.

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,700
So that should give us 250 and it does.

43
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,790
And if we look at the list now it has 2 items in it 201 and 350.

44
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,320
Let's do.

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,070
Let's remove the last item index of 1 cool so that called Pop.

46
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,310
And if you look at the list now it has one item left let's do list.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,570
Remove the zero with item and we look at the list.

48
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,770
It's empty now.

49
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,980
Try and remove something that isn't in there that's not going to work.

50
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,770
Have it a positive number.

51
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,650
Cool.

52
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,080
So that is remove.
