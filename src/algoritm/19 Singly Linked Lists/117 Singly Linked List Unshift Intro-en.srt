1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,640
All right we'll come back and this video we're working on adding another shift to our singly linked

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,080
list.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,150
So upshift is a way to add a node to the list.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,640
However unlike push it adds to the beginning of the list.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,630
And fortunately it's pretty easy because of the way the singly link first works works.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,860
We already have the head.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,360
All we have to do is say Here is a new head and pointed to the old head.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,050
So if we walked through it over here let's do an insert at the beginning to insert the number.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,860
No there we go 13.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,520
OK I'm going to posit.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,770
So all we do is we have the old head and we now point the new head at the head and then move the head

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,000
to be the new head.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,640
It's kind of confusing when I keep saying all that new head but we just take this old pointer and the

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,540
value there we take the new node pointed at that and then set this to be the head.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,690
And that's it.

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,000
So if we were to walk through the pseudo code to find the function accepts the value that you're going

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,180
to add to the beginning you're shifting or you're shifting.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,900
So we create a new node just like we did with Bush.

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,800
We need to check if there is no head.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,700
Then we set the head and tail to be the new node.

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:19,140
Otherwise set the newly created nodes next property to be the current head and then move the head to

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,710
be that newly created node and then increment the length the list by 1 and finally return the linked

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,600
list.

24
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,460
OK.

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,960
So try and do this on your own if you'd like.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,790
In the next video as I have been doing this whole section I'll have a solution.

27
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:33,980
All right.

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,820
That's coming up next.
