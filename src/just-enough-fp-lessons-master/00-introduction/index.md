# Introduction to Just Enough Functional Programming in JavaScript

In this introductory course on functional programming, we will learn "just enough" of the concepts you need to start using the programming paradigm.

One of the goals of this course is to introduce as little jargon as necessary. Functional programming vernacular can be very intimidating and a barrier to entry, so we'll avoid those whenever possible.

Another goal of this course is to teach the concepts in a language agnostic fashion. While this course is written in JavaScript, the concepts can be applied to any functional programming language, such as Haskell, Scala, Clojure, etc.

Together we will learn about higher order functions, pure and impure functions, immutable data structures, currying, partial application, the importance of argument order, pointfree programming, composition, a tiny bit of math with the associative property, and how to debug functional compositions.

My personal hope with this course is to inspire you to take what you learn here and go explore functional programming more.
